# Testing Activity 

Suppose you are tasked with implementing a function that takes in two numbers
and determines if they are co-prime numbers.
Co-prime numbers are pairs of numbers that do not have any common factors
other than 1.
For instance, 6 and 5 are co-prime numbers because:
* 6 has factors 1, 2, 3, and 6
* 5 has factors 1, 5
<br><br><br>
## Part 1:
Come up with 10 different pairs of co-prime numbers.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## Part 2:
Think about what can be "fundamentally different" about different pairs of co-prime numbers (or not pairs). 
Try to list out a few different test cases (maybe some of the pairs
you mentioned above) and describe what is fundamentally different.
