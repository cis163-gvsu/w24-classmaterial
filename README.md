# Welcome to CIS 163:  Computer Science II

### Course Overview
This course should help you go from being able to program to writing good code that is correct.
This can mean a lot of things:
* clear, clean, and concise
* algorithmically elegant
* well-tested, handles edge cases, well-thought
* efficient (from an algorithmic complexity way)
* appropriate selection of data structures.

Unlike 162 where the goal is just to write code to solve a problem, the goal here is to really think about
what you are coding, how you are solving the problem, what it means to be correct, etc.
This requires a deeper understanding
of what is happening and the code and a more intentional approach.

### Need Help?
If you have questions, please ask!  I'm here to help.  I welcome students
to drop by office hours to work on their projects and
listen to questions others might have (or chat
about other CS topics, grad school, etc.)
