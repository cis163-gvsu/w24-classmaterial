## Piazza
We will be using Piazza for **all class related communication**.
Please read the [Piazza FAQ](piazza-faq.md) for more details.  
In particular, note that important announcements will be posted
to Piazza and you are responsible for monitoring it and
that **all questions and concerns**
should be posted to Piazza (instead of emailed).  Emails
will likely be redirected to be posted to Piazza and then
answered there.  Piazza is available
both web-based and as a phone app.

## Course Materials
* [Python Object-Oriented Programming - Fourth Edition, Steven F. Lott, Dusty Phillips](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-object-oriented-programming/9781801077262/)
* This book is freely available from O'Reilly, through a GVSU subscription.  If you already have an O'Reilly account, the above link should work for you.  If you don't, you may access the book by going to [https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/](https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/).  From there,
  * Click the "Institution not listed" link
  * Enter your GVSU email
  * Click "Let's Go"
  * Search for the book listed above
* Reading the text is extremely important for your learning.  This book was selected over other options because students frequently cite lack of funds as the reason they don't purchase and use course textbooks.  It is expected that you read the required chapters, and quiz and exam questions will be drawn from the chapters.

## Course Objectives
After completing the course, students will be able to:
* develop good quality programs in Python 
* manipulate fundamental data structures: lists (arrays), strings, linked lists, stacks, and queues. 
* solve problems using object-oriented principles (inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and interface classes, containers/collections, and iterators). 
* use UML class diagrams to represent design of object-oriented programs. 
* analyze run-time performance of algorithms using Big-O notation. 
* use an IDE (PyCharm) for development.
* interpret technical programming documentation (Python API). 

## Course Topics
* Lists (Arrays)
* Inheritance, Polymorphism 
* Interfaces 
* Exceptions 
* Recursion 
* Searching and Sorting 
* Analysis of Algorithms 
* Generics and Collections, Lambda and Streams 
* Data Structures – Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues 
* Testing and Debugging 
* UML Class diagrams 

## Instructor’s Expectations
The instructor expects students to:
* Attend class regularly and arrive on time.
* Participate in class activities.
* Ask lots of questions in and out of class.
* Come to office hours and tutoring sessions.
* Write professional quality code that is well-designed, well-formatted, well-commented, and highly readable.

## Special Needs
If there is any student in this class who has special needs because of a disability, please contact https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ (DSS) at 616-331-2490.

## Academic Honesty
All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information Systems, the details of which can be found at [https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

Academic integrity is taken very seriously and typically result in anywhere
from a 0 on the assessment along with a reduction in the overall course grade
to failure in the course.  All instances of academic integrity will be reported
to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR).  Fundamentally,
the work you submit must be your own.  **When in doubt, ask the instructor
first and cite any resources.**

#### FAQs:

* Can I use ChatGPT, Gtihub Co-pilot, or similar AI/ML based technologies? *No, the work you
  submit must be your own and all code should be written by you, so this would
  be considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I seek help through sites like upwork? *No, this would generally be
  considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I have help from a tutor?  *You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
  you submit for projects in the end must be your own.  You may not consult
  tutors when taking exams.*
* Can I use sites like stackoverflow?  *Yes, this is allowed in this course,
  so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
  for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
  portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).*
* Can I use sites like Chegg?  *No, this would be considered an academic
  integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question*
* Can I use general online resources?  *That depends.
  Fundamentally, the work you turn in must
  be your own.  This means that heavily basing your solution on (or directly copying)
  code for a significant component of a problem is not allowed.  Talk to me first.*

#### Regret Policy
I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after.  In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy".  Within 48 hours of
the due date (or late deadline if working on it late)
for a project or within 48 hours of completing an exam, you can
withdraw your submission if after contemplation you believe you may have committed
academic misconduct.  To do so, you must inform me in via email or private Piazza
note within 48 hours of the due date / late deadline including the following text:

> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause
1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened.  Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
  invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date / late
deadline / exam completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

## Grading

* You must have at least an average of at least 60% on all tests to pass with a grade of "C" or better.
* Your grade in the course will be determined based on all the work assigned (see table below) in the course using the grading scale shown below.

| Item  | Percent of Overall Grade   |
| ----- | ----- |
| Programming Project 1	                | 10% |
| Programming Project 2                 | 15% |
| Programming Project 3                 | 15% |
| Tests	                                | 30% |
| Final Exam                            | 20% |
| Labs/Participation/Class Attendance   | 10% |


## Grading Scale:
The instructor reserves the right to shift the scale downward at the end of the semester,
in the student’s favor, to find natural break points within the classes scores.
This shift downward typically occurs at the end of the semester. 
The scale will never shift upward.
For example: 88% is always at least a B+.)

|     |    |    |    |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A	 | 94% | C  | 73% |
| A- | 90% | C-	| 70% |
| B+ | 88% | D+	| 67% |
| B	 | 84% | D	| 60% |
| B- | 80% | F	| below 60% |
| C+ | 77% |    |   |

## Programming Projects
Programming projects require considerable amount of time outside of class. I advise you to budget your time properly. You are encouraged to discuss the assignment specifications with your instructor (and with your fellow students). However, anything that you submit for grading must be your own work. 

### Submission & Late Policy.
* Late penalty is 20% first day, non-first day 10% per day (unless otherwisestated in the assignment). Weekend counts as one weekday. Projects will not be accepted after one week late.
* Some projects may have a code review after.  If that is the case,
  there will be a deadline that your project must be in by in order
  to participate in the code review.  If your project is not in by that
  date, then you will be unable to particpate in the code review and will
  not receive credit for that portion of the project.
* You will be required to demo your project to the instructor.  
* Any part of a project that works, but that you are unable to explain why or how is considered "non-functional" and may result in a reduction of points after the fact (and depending on the circumstances, may be academic misconduct).

## Course Policies
* All homework and programming projects, unless otherwise specified by the instructor,
  are to be completed individually. Students are encouraged to consult each other for instructional assistance only.
* The instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course calendar, and assignment point values and due dates.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at [http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/).


### PrairieLearn Policies
PrairieLearn (PL) will be used for coding projects, labs, and tests.
PL is an online system that will allow you to submit code for
autograding.  You will be able to submit, see your grade, and resubmit
prior to the due date/time to improve your grade without penalty as
many times as you wish.  Except in cases of academic integrity violations,
attempts to fool the autograder, or turning in code that you do not understand,
(all of which may result in your score being lowered after the fact),
your score for autograded problems will be the score on PrairieLearn (unless you
submit after the deadline and late days are up, in which case your
score for the project will not change).
If you submit code that does not run or compile,
you will receive a 0.  Any partial credit for the autograded portion
will be awarded by the autograder; no
additional partial credit will be awarded.  For projects, there
may be a manually graded portion as well -- these points will be
awarded manually.  

The goal of using PL is to, as a whole, improve grades by
allowing you to assess your solution and continue to refine it.
For coding problems, there are often both visible test cases and hidden
test cases.  For many problems, the hidden test cases are edge cases
that may not be something that was considered when you first developed
your approach to the problem.  The goal of the autograder is to

1. Let you see when your solution is correct
2. Help you become a better programmer by forcing you to think
   carefully about what scenarios may arise.

If you believe there is an issue
with the autograder, please post a private note on Piazza ASAP.

### Test Policies
Tests will be taken on PrairieLearn during lab and consist of both
non-coding (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.) questions
and one or more coding questions.
You may look at python documentation, course notes, your projects,
 and your labs during the tests.

You are **not** allowed to look for and/or use a solution online,
give help to or receive help from anyone else,
discuss the tests with anyone, regardless of whether or not
they are in the course, or use an AI-based tool.

The room will be recorded during tests to ensure academic integrity.
By taking the tests you consent to being recorded.
Please reach out to the professor no later than the end of the first
week of class if you have concerns.


### Fina Exam

The final exam is closed-book/closed-note.
It will tentatively be taken in person on PrairieLearn,
though a switch to a paper exam may still be necessary.

The room will be recorded during the final exam to ensure academic integrity.
By taking the final exam you consent to being recorded.
Please reach out to the professor no later than the end of the first
week of class if you have concerns.


## Equity and Inclusion
As an instructor, I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning
environment in our class.  Please reach out to me if there is any behavior in
the classroom that makes you feel unwelcome in any way.  To the extent permitted
by law, I will keep this information confidential.
