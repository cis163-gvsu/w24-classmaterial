# Sorting

---


### Insertion Sort

* Breaks list into to parts (sorted and not sorted)
* Goes through values
* For each value, inserts into the right spot in the sorted list
* Move onto next value, repeating process

### Insertion Sort - Complexity

* How many times do we go look at a value?
* For each value, how much work does it take (how many spots do we consider) to find the right spot?
